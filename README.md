# projects
Here are my projects that I work on, mostly tutorials

List of projects:

1.[Quote Guessing Game using Web Scraping in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quote-guessing-game-using-web-scraping-in-python/)

2.[Web scraping from Wikipedia using Python â€“ A Complete Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-scrape-multiple-pages-of-a-website-using-python/?ref=next_article)

3.[Scrape IMDB movie rating and details using Python and saving the details of top movies to .csv file](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scrape-imdb-movie-rating-and-details-using-python/)

4.[Scraping Amazon Product Information using Beautiful Soup](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scraping-amazon-product-information-using-beautiful-soup/)- having trouble with getting the data from the website, has to do something with the javascript, I think the best course of action is to use selenium, will try to remake it in the future with selenium

6.[Scraping Indeed Job Data Using Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scraping-indeed-job-data-using-python/) - the code executes, but the same problem like with project 4., I get no data back, possible solution is to use selenium

Minsweeper
  -created a minesweeper game
  - almost done
  - the only thing missing is the feature of auto-completion(when you uncover a '0' tile, it doesn't uncover surrounding non-bomb tiles)
